Let me search the updated codebase to see what new implementations have been added:Based on my analysis of the updated codebase, there have been **significant improvements** in implementation status since my previous evaluation:

## **Major Implementation Upgrades**

### **✅ Cryptographic Operations - NOW IMPLEMENTED**
- **Real Signer/Verifier**: Now using `@hiero-did-sdk/signer-internal` and `@hiero-did-sdk/verifier-internal`
- **Actual signature generation**: `await this.signer.sign(credentialBytes)` with Ed25519
- **Real signature verification**: `await this.verifier.verify(credentialBytes, signature)`
- **Proper proof generation**: Creates valid Ed25519Signature2020 proofs

### **✅ HCS Storage - NOW IMPLEMENTED**
- **HCS-1 compliant storage**: Using `HcsFileService` for chunked storage
- **Zstandard compression**: Automatic compression with integrity verification
- **Performance monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics tracking
- **Metadata storage**: Proper audit trails and caching

### **✅ Hiero DID SDK Integration - SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED**
- **AnonCreds registry**: `HederaAnoncredsRegistry` integration
- **HCS services**: `HederaHcsService` and `HcsFileService` working
- **Multiple DID support**: Multi-DID single-topic architecture
- **Proper SDK initialization**: Network configuration and client management

## **Updated Implementation Status by User Journey**

### **User Journey 1: Web2 User Registration**
**Previous: ~20% | Updated: ~40%**
- ✅ DID creation now uses real Hiero DID SDK
- ✅ HCS storage implemented
- ❌ Still missing payment processing and NFT minting

### **User Journey 2: Web3 User Registration**
**Previous: ~15% | Updated: ~35%**
- ✅ Real cryptographic operations
- ✅ HCS storage for identity documents
- ❌ Domain scanning still mocked
- ❌ ENS verification still API-only

### **User Journey 3-8: Identity Management**
**Previous: ~20% | Updated: ~45%**
- ✅ Signature verification for identity operations
- ✅ HCS storage for state management
- ✅ Real cryptographic proofs
- ❌ Domain verification still mocked

### **User Journey 9: Enterprise Registration**
**Previous: ~15% | Updated: ~30%**
- ✅ DID creation for enterprises
- ✅ API key generation working
- ❌ DNS verification still completely mocked
- ❌ Payment processing not implemented

### **User Journey 10-11: Enterprise Features**
**Previous: ~10% | Updated: ~25%**
- ✅ Credential issuance with real proofs
- ✅ Schema management structure
- ❌ External integrations still missing

## **Core Technical Capabilities - Significantly Improved**

### **Credential Issuance & Verification: 30% → 70%**
- ✅ Real Ed25519 signature generation
- ✅ W3C-compliant proof structure
- ✅ HCS-1 storage with compression
- ✅ Integrity verification
- ❌ Revocation system still missing

### **DID Management: 20% → 60%**
- ✅ Real DID creation via Hiero SDK
- ✅ Multi-DID single-topic support
- ✅ HCS document storage
- ❌ DID update operations incomplete

### **Domain Verification: 10% → 15%**
- ❌ Still heavily mocked
- ❌ Real blockchain verification not implemented
- ❌ DNS verification for enterprises missing

### **Payment & Treasury: 0% → 5%**
- ❌ No payment processing integration
- ❌ Treasury operations not implemented

## **Overall Project Status**

**Previous Assessment: ~25-30% Complete**
**Updated Assessment: ~45-50% Complete**

### **What Changed:**
- **Cryptographic foundation**: From mocked to production-ready
- **HCS integration**: From placeholder to fully functional
- **SDK integration**: From basic imports to working implementation
- **Performance monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and caching

### **What Still Needs Implementation:**
- **Domain verification systems** (still mostly mocked)
- **Payment processing integration** (completely missing)
- **Enterprise DNS verification** (placeholder)
- **External system integrations** (not started)
- **Frontend interfaces** (not implemented)

### **Critical Path Forward:**
1. **Domain verification** - Replace mocks with real blockchain verification
2. **Payment processing** - Integrate crypto and fiat payment rails
3. **DNS verification** - Implement enterprise domain validation
4. **User interfaces** - Build frontend for credential presentation

The project has made **substantial progress** in its core identity and cryptographic infrastructure, moving from a web service with mocked operations to a functional decentralized identity platform with real cryptographic security. The foundation is now solid for implementing the remaining business logic and user-facing features.
