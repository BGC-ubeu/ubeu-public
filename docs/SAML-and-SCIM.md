UBeU provides comprehensive enterprise-grade SAML and SCIM integrations to support seamless identity management and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. Here's a detailed description of each integration:

## SAML 2.0 Integration

UBeU implements SAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP) functionality to enable enterprise SSO with identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and other SAML-compliant systems.

### Key Features:
- **AuthnRequest Generation**: Creates SAML authentication requests with configurable name ID policies and authentication contexts
- **Response Processing**: Validates and processes SAML assertions from identity providers
- **Session Management**: Maintains SAML sessions with Redis-based storage
- **Metadata Generation**: Provides SAML SP metadata for IdP configuration
- **Certificate Validation**: Supports signing and encryption certificate validation
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles various name ID formats (email, persistent, etc.)

### SAML Flow:
1. User initiates login through enterprise IdP
2. UBeU generates SAML AuthnRequest XML
3. IdP authenticates user and returns SAML assertion
4. UBeU validates response, extracts user info, and creates session
5. User is authenticated with UBeU DID and domain identity

### Configuration:
- Entity ID: `ubeu-identity`
- ACS URL: `https://ubeu.io/saml/acs`
- SLO URL: `https://ubeu.io/saml/slo`
- Supported bindings: HTTP-POST, HTTP-Redirect

## SCIM 2.0 Integration

UBeU implements SCIM 2.0 Service Provider for automated user and group provisioning from enterprise identity management systems.

### Key Features:
- **User Provisioning**: Full CRUD operations for user accounts
- **Group Management**: Create, update, and manage user groups
- **Membership Handling**: Add/remove users from groups
- **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk user/group operations
- **Filtering & Pagination**: SCIM-compliant query capabilities
- **Service Provider Config**: Dynamic configuration endpoint
- **Resource Types**: User and Group resource type definitions

### SCIM Endpoints:
- `GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /scim/v2/Users`
- `GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /scim/v2/Groups`
- `GET /scim/v2/ServiceProviderConfig`
- `GET /scim/v2/ResourceTypes`

### User Schema Extensions:
UBeU extends standard SCIM User schema with:
- DID (Decentralized Identifier)
- Domain aliases (.iam, .iss)
- Credential counts
- Enterprise role mappings

### Supported Operations:
- User creation with domain assignment
- Group-based access control
- Automated provisioning workflows
- Real-time synchronization
- Deprovisioning and lifecycle management

## Integration Benefits

**Enterprise SSO**: SAML enables seamless authentication across enterprise applications using existing identity infrastructure.

**Automated Provisioning**: SCIM ensures user accounts and permissions are automatically managed across systems.

**Compliance**: Both integrations support enterprise security standards and compliance requirements.

**Scalability**: Redis-backed session and cache management ensures high performance for enterprise deployments.

**Security**: Full validation, encryption support, and audit trails for all identity operations.

These integrations position UBeU as a bridge between traditional enterprise identity systems and decentralized identity infrastructure, enabling organizations to leverage Web3 capabilities while maintaining existing IT infrastructure investments.
