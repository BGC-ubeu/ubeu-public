# Technical Design Document: Credential Import and Wrapping Feature for UBeU

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a feature allowing UBeU users to import and wrap external verifiable credentials (VCs) from Open Badges-compliant platforms (e.g., Credly, Badgr) into privacy-preserving UBeU VCs. The process verifies the external credential off-chain and issues a wrapped AnonCreds VC anchored to the user's DID and HCS topic, enhancing portability and integration within UBeU's decentralized identity ecosystem. 

*The feature should not be described as a technology that "anchors your credentials to Hedera," but rather as a tool that further aligns UBeU with the philosophy of a `self-sovereign` and portable digital identity. UBeU's credential import service positions UBeU as a universal platform for credentials otherwise fragmented across siloed platforms. Import and wrap existing credentials for privacy preserving and ZKP presentation.*  

**Goals:**
- Enable seamless import of existing credentials without direct storage transfer.
- Support full revocation syncing.
- Maintain privacy via zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) using @hiero-did-sdk/anoncreds.
- Abstract Hedera complexities for Web2/Web3 users, with treasury-sponsored fees.
- Support multi-platform imports for broad compatibility.

**Scope:** Frontend dashboard integration, backend service, SDK usage, HCS/Hedera storage, revocation syncing.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **User Flow:** In the dashboard, users select "Import and Wrap Existing Credentials," provide platform (e.g., Credly), badge URL/JSON/ID, and optional OAuth for batch imports.
- **Verification:** Off-chain validation of Open Badges (OB) metadata and signature.
- **Issuance:** Wrap valid OB as AnonCreds VC, referencing original as evidence.
- **Revocation:**
- **Storage:** Store wrapped VC, link to user's DID and HCS topic.
- **Audit/Tracking:** Log to HCS audit trail.
- **Platforms Supported (v1):** Credly, Badgr (Instructure), Accredible, Sertifier, Certifier, Moodle (via OB plugin). Extendable via config.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Verification < 5s; issuance < 10s (async via @hiero-did-sdk/lifecycle).
- **Security:** ECDSA signature checks; nonce for replays; GDPR-compliant encryption.
- **Scalability:** Handle 1K imports/day; use Mirror Node caching for resolution.
- **Cost:** Sponsor fees (~$0.0001 USD per op, increases to $0.0008 in 2026) via treasury
- **Rate Limiting** Allowance of 100 external credentials/user. *Re-confirm all-in treasury sponsored cost of $0.0001 per wrapped credential (HCS transaction fee increases to $0.0008 in 2026)* 
- **Compatibility:** Align with OB 3.0 and W3C VC 2.0; support DIDs via @hiero-did-sdk/registrar.

## 3. Architecture and Design

### High-Level Components
- **Frontend (React/Next.js):** Dashboard UI. Form fields: platform dropdown, URL/JSON input, OAuth button. Display tooltip: "Verify and wrap your external credential in a UBeU VC for Hedera-anchored use."
- **Backend (Node.js/Express):** New endpoint `/api/credentials/import` uses `CredentialImportService` for logic.
- **Service Layer:** `CredentialImportService` . Integrates @hiero-did-sdk (verifier, anoncreds, hcs, lifecycle).
- **Database:** Update `account_mappings` and `anoncreds_registry` schemas in PostgreSQL for wrapped VC metadata. Track in `network_spend`.
- **Hedera Integration:** HCS topics for Schemas/CredDefs as HCS-1 Files; multi-DID single-topic via @hiero-did-sdk/hcs.
- **External APIs:** Platform-specific (e.g., Credly REST API for GET /issued_badges; Badgr API for exports). Use OAuth2 for user-authorized access.

### Data Models
- **Input Payload:** `{ platform: string, badgeUrl?: string, obJson?: object, oauthToken?: string }`
- **Wrapped VC Schema (AnonCreds):** Attributes: `{ originalIssuer: string, evidence: object, platform: string }`. Stored as JSON Domain Records.
- **NetworkSpendRecord Update:** Add entry: `{ userId: string, opType: 'credential_wrap', costUsdCents: int64, consensusTime: int64 }`.
- **HCS Message:** DIDCredentialIssuedMessage via @hiero-did-sdk/messages, submitted to user's HCS topic.

### Sequence Diagram (Textual)
1. User submits import form → Frontend calls `/api/credentials/import`.
2. Controller authenticates JWT → Passes to CredentialImportService.
3. Service: 
   - If OAuth, fetch badges via platform API (e.g., Credly OAuth2).
   - Parse OB JSON from URL/JSON.
   - Verify signature/metadata with @hiero-did-sdk/verifier (off-chain ECDSA).
4. If valid: 
   - Issue AnonCreds VC via @hiero-did-sdk/anoncreds (holder: userDID, evidence: original OB).
   - Store Schema/CredDef in HCS-1 File.
   - Submit to HCS topic via @hiero-did-sdk/hcs.
   - Update UBeURegistry and PostgreSQL.
   - Calc cost via Exchange Rate precompile (0x168); update NetworkSpendRecord.
5. Return success/VC ID to frontend; display in dashboard.
6. Credential revocation capability...?

### Integration Points
- **@hiero-did-sdk:**
  - Registrar: Link to user DID.
  - Resolver: Cache via Mirror Node for fast lookups.
  - Anoncreds: Issue/Store VCs; support ZKPs for presentation.
  - Verifier/Signer: OB validation and signing.
  - HCS: Multi-DID topic management; audit logging.
- **Treasury Sponsorship:** Use Treasury Service to sign/submit/pay txs; track in hcs_topics.
- **Error Handling:** Custom errors (e.g., `error CredentialInvalid();`); retry on transient failures.

## 4. Security Considerations
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize URLs/JSON; limit size to 10KB.
- **Signature Verification:** Mandatory ECDSA checks; use @hiero-did-sdk/crypto for multibase.
- **Access Control:** Role-based (USER_ROLE).
- **Privacy:** Encrypt evidence in HFS; use AnonCreds for selective disclosure.
- **Replay Protection:** Nonce in import payload, verified via @hiero-did-sdk/lifecycle.
- **Rate Limiting:** 100 verified wrapped imports; 10 imports/hour/user to prevent abuse.
- **Compliance:** Log consents in analytics_events; ensure revocable via anoncreds_revreg_entries.

## 5. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Jest for CredentialImportService (mock SDK, test verification/issuance paths).
- **Integration Tests:** Testnet for end-to-end (import Credly sample → verify wrapped VC).
- **Edge Cases:** Invalid OB, allowance exceeded, OAuth failures, large batches.
- **Security Tests:** Fuzz inputs; audit for reentrancy (though off-chain heavy).

## 6. Deployment and Monitoring
- **Monorepo Deployment:** Use Lerna to build/deploy backend/frontend.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions; test on Hedera testnet.
- **Monitoring:** Track via analytics_events; network spend monitoring.
- **Rollback:** Pausable via contract if issues.

This design ensures Hedera-native implementation with seamless user experience, leveraging Hiero SDK for efficiency.
